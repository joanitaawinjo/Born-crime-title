                    <p>This title <b>"It is Arpatheid"</b> relates to the book's details of being born a crime in a way
                        that Trevor Noah talked about his
                        life in the apartheid era and also himself being born as a colored child which was a crime by
                        then.
                        This is revealed in his childhood where he lives the life of an outsider being discriminated
                        against by
                        both the blacks and the whites. This fortunately shaped his character in the future after
                        Apartheid.

            <p id="quote"><i>"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with
                    subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a

            <p id="reflection">About the Quote “Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife … but never
                fell in love with
                subservient women.. ‘He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage”.
                This is solely true because Abel was a transitional man from Tzaneen where girls were raised purposely
                to
                respect and bow down to men and expected to do specific work. For example they were to cook and do house
                chores
                and take care of children and their siblings. But truly this is not what Patricia was. Patricia was a
                hard
                working woman who used to freely move in towns, work in order to navigate on how to take care of her
                family and
                educate her child Trevor. Therefore Abel wanted someone he could rule for because Patricia was
                independent. This
                truly explains why the quote says “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in
                a cage.”
                Most men like Abel want women to stay at home, cook, clean, manage his calendar, facilitate his business
                and
                manage
                family relationships and responsibilities. He expects her wife to shut up about his ways like verbal
                abuse, any
                time he disrespected and exploited her. This was manifested when Abel came back drunk and almost burnt
                the
                house
                but when Patricia tried to tell him, he just beat her up and also when he hit her with a bicycle because
                of
                condemning what he was doing. Such men want wives to be readily available, affectionate and supportive
                even
                after all the times he discouraged, pressured and created obstacles for her. This is evidenced when Abel
                shot
                Patricia narrowly surviving death after she left him and got another husband.Yeah These men are like
                exotic bird
                collector cause without doubt, they can't fall in love with independent women.
